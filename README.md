# maze
First major project/game (Written in 2013, added to Github in 2015)

### HOW TO PLAY
You are marked as an 'X' on the map. A '?' represents a place you have not yet visited. Move with WASD.

As you explore the map, you will find monsters armor, and weapons.
On the map, weapons are indicated as '$', armor as '@', and monsters as '!'

You have 4 statistics:
* HP:    Your health. This comes from your armor. If it reaches 0, you die.
* ATK:   This is the amount of damage you do per attack. This comes from your weapon.
* CRIT:  This is your chance to critical hit. If you happen to get a critical hit, you will do double damage but your chance to crit on your weapon will permanently decrease by 3. Also, the lower your crit is, you have a higher chance of getting a 'Terrible Aim'. If this happens, your weapon's atk will permanently decrease by 1. Your crit value comes from your weapon.
* DODGE: This is your chance to dodge an attack. If you dodge, you, will take 0 damage. This comes from both your armor and weapon.

You can also craft armor together. If you find an armor, you can press 'c' and add 2/3 the HP of the armor with the lowest HP to the other.

Your goal is to make it though the maze and defeat The Gatekeeper.
Good luck.
